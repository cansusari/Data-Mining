Part2: Principal component coefficients and the transformed dataset are computed
Part3: The variance of each variable in the transformed dataset is calculated & the informative attributes which covers the 90% of the total variance are selected
Part4: The transformed data onto the new coordinate system by using the two most informative attributes principal components is plotted
